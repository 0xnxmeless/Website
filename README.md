# Website

My new portfolio/personal website. This is heavily overengineered, and pretty much everything on this website is dynamic.

I would not recommend using this code for your own personal website, some of this code isn't great and probably won't perform well under particular circumstances, but for the sake of my personal website, it's more than adequate.

I don't consider myself a "professional" programmer, so if you do have any suggestions on how I can improve my code, feel free to contact me through any of the contact links, listed [here](https://domhoe.dev/contacts).

# Technologies Used

This website uses the following technologies:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)

I have gathered a considerable amount of knowledge in building this project, including certain features of Prisma that I wasn't aware of prior to building some of the features into this website.

# Setup
